# Crypto plotter
This is a mini-project that monitors your crypto account and miner (worker).

## But why? :shrug:
As you easily can monitor your account and worker online, the real purpouse of the project was to learn about the ESP8266 and OLED module.

Using the ESP8266 and connecting to my local WiFi, I was able to fetch data from the [Nanopool API](https://eth.nanopool.org/api). I then plottet the data on the OLED display and used it to display stats on the local servers webpage.

Having the luxury of owning a 3D printer, I designed a small case to fit both modules. Below is an image of the final result.
